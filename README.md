All projects in this repository were created solely in the course of academic work.

1. HomeEquityLoans  
   The main objective of this project was to identify the key features that distinguish good and bad bank customers using the HMEQ dataset.  
   The analysis includes several advanced data-analytics techniques, such as:
   - MICE imputation  
   - SMOTE sample balancing  
   - Ensemble learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting & Random Forest)  
   - Clustering algorithms (PCA & K-means)

2. Probability of default calibration  
   This project provides a compact Python function for Bayesian validation of Probability of Default (PD) estimates.  
   It uses a Beta posterior with Jeffreys prior to compute the Highest Density Interval (HDI) and performs the Jeffreys test to assess calibration.

3. Quantum Machine Learning – Airline Passenger Satisfaction  
   The primary objective of this project was to implement a simulated quantum machine-learning model.  
   A classical neural network was developed and compared with an equivalent hybrid architecture incorporating a single quantum layer.  
   The results indicated that the hybrid model did not yield improvements in computational time or predictive performance relative to the purely classical model.
