All projects in this repository were created solely by me in the course of my academic work.

1. HomeEquityLoans  
   The main objective of this project was to identify the key features that distinguish good and bad bank customers using the HMEQ dataset.  
   The analysis includes several advanced data-analytics techniques, such as:
   - MICE imputation  
   - SMOTE sample balancing  
   - Ensemble learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting & Random Forest)  
   - Clustering algorithms (PCA & K-means)

2. Probability of default calibration  
   This project provides a compact Python function for Bayesian validation of Probability of Default (PD) estimates.  
   It uses a Beta posterior with Jeffreys prior to compute the Highest Density Interval (HDI) and performs the Jeffreys test to assess calibration.
